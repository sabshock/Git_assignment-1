The ‘country-capital-api’ repository houses the code for an API written in Python and Flask that returns the name of the country if a capital city is provided with all its dependencies.
Also, there is a microservice endpoint for this API available at https://example.com/country-capital/<query-params> that can be used by any project in the organization to consume this API.
